To send form data to an email, you would typically need to use a server-side script, such as PHP, to process the form data and send an email. Unfortunately, HTML alone cannot handle the sending of emails. Here's a simplified example using PHP:
Create a new PHP file (e.g., process_form.php):

<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $name = $_POST["name"];
    $email = $_POST["email"];
    $message = $_POST["message"];
    $to = "your@example.com"; // Replace with your email address
    $subject = "New Contact Form Submission";
    $headers = "From: $email";
    $mailBody = "Name: $name\nEmail: $email\nMessage:\n$message";
    mail($to, $subject, $mailBody, $headers);
}
?>
Replace "your@example.com" with the actual email address where you want to receive the form submissions.
Update your HTML form action attribute to point to the PHP file:
<form action="process_form.php" method="post">
</form>
This way, when the "Send Now" button is pressed, the form data will be submitted to process_form.php, which will process the data and send an email.
Note: Ensure that your server supports PHP, and the mail() function is configured correctly. Additionally, this is a basic example, and in a production environment, you would need to implement additional security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent potential security issues.
